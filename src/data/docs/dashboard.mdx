## Purpose

The dashboard is the user's central control panel after authentication. It provides a one-glance summary of assigned work (pending transactions), recent activity, service distribution visualizations, and shortcuts to commonly used workflows.

## High-level layout

- Global header: top-most persistent area with search, notifications, user profile and primary navigation.
- Primary navigation row: horizontal menu for access to major sections (Home, My Pending Approvals, My Approved Transactions, Transactions Timeline, Registered Entities, Reports & Analytics).
- Main content area split into two columns:
	- Left column: primary dashboard content (Pending Transactions cards grid, distribution chart, summary charts).
	- Right column: Recent Activities timeline and quick actions.

## Features

### Global header & user greeting

- Greeting text: "Welcome! [User Full Name]" â€” shown top-left beneath the header area.
- Search control: small search input in the header to quickly locate transactions or entities (hotkey hint displayed: Ctrl K).
- Notifications icon: bell with unread badge; clicking opens a short list or notifications center.
- Profile menu: user avatar/username dropdown with links to "My Dashboard", "My Profile", "Sign Out".

### Primary navigation (menu)

- Items shown: Home (My Dashboard), My Pending Approvals, My Approved Transactions, Transactions Timeline, Registered Entities, Reports & Analytics.
- The active item is visually highlighted and has an accessible label.

### Pending Transactions panel

This is the key area that lists quick-stat tiles for assigned/related transaction categories. Each tile contains:

- An icon representing the category (circular icon background).
- A numeric count (e.g., "41" for Total Transactions).
- A short label (e.g., "Total Transactions", "Registrations", "Filings", "Changes").
- Optional trend indicator (small arrow up/down and color) to show change vs previous period.

Available categories are:

- Total Transactions
- Registrations
- Queries
- Changes
- Renewals
- Official liquidation
- Filings
- Mergers
- Divisions
- Conversions

### Pending Transactions Distribution (pie chart)

- A visual distribution (pie chart) labeled "Service Distribution" and showing the total assigned and slice labels for each service (Changes, Renewals, Official liquidation, Filings, Mergers, Divisions, Registrations, Conversions).
- Legend on the left with colored keys for each service type.

Behavior and notes:
- Hovering a slice shows a tooltip with the service name, count and percentage.
- Clicking a slice filters/right-navigates to the corresponding list of transactions.

### Recent Activities (right column timeline)

- Chronological list of recent items (each row includes an icon, type link, short summary, and time-ago stamp).

### "My Approved Transaction" summary (date range + chart)

- Date range picker (top-right of the chart card) to choose the date window for the summary.
- Title: "Total Transactions Approval for Today : X" and a subtitle "Status Breakdown".
- A large bar chart shows counts by subcategory within the selected date range.
